Not every Dyspersium-rich world has the necessary infrastructure to establish communication, y'know? Anyways, I don't wanna get too consumed by the basics, so let's cut to the chase - I'm here to provide you blueprints. Don't get too bothered about why or how - just keep doing what you're doing, and I'll send 'em over when I can. We'll start with something simple: an HEP. Classic powergen, as I'm sure you know.",
