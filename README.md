##### The Industrizer!

This is a full-scale tech mod for Minecraft, currently stuck on 1.16.5. Once the "MVP" features outlined below are implemented and working, 
I'm going to shift focus towards updating to 1.19.

#### What's in it?

Mostly skeletons and architectural work for some broader upcoming features.
 - A basic "economy" and wallet system for buying and selling blocks, with a degree of market fluctuation and region-based demand/supply curves.
 - The earliest iteration of an ingame wiki integration with cross-page linking and full-depth filter searching.
 - An elaborate progression and employment system to motivate automation, with pivotal Permits and Authorizations to unlock phases of progression, all delivered through an ingame 
   email client.
 - Daily "contracts" and assignments involving bulk orders, PvP espionage and special exploration.
 - Many threatening forces, from nosy interdimensional police, to hostile competitors, and even merciless debt collectors.
 - Classic automation chains in the vein of full-fat tech mods like Thermal and ENDER I/O, with a bit of a focus on mass-production assembly lines a.la Factorio.
 - Allegiances, a complicated alchemical mapping of every block in the game for wild production-chains and pseudomagical shortcuts
 - Loads more - multi-pipe-blocks, automatic market manipulation, dangerous artifacts, unnerving dimensions, mad industrial rituals! We're not in the business of stifling ambition.

#### What's first?

The above outline is broad, and though a lot of it is here in parts, the process of polishing and expanding it is concievably infinite. The first "public" CurseForge build is gonna go live when the following MVP features, called Phase I, are finished. Until then, ask me directly for access to a testing build at iznaroth@gmail.com or through discord.

### Phase I 
 - Stable economy - demand curves, autobuy/sell, robust market information. (~60%)
 - Factory-line fundamentals - Etchers, Assemblers, Infusers and Condensers - and all fundamental intermediaries (~40%)
 - Logistics fundamentals - Belts thru Highways for throughput, tubes and multitube stuffing for precise networking (~35%)
 - Progression and Information - Email & Wiki in usable state. (60%)
 - Alchemy - fully-scoped/tagged Allegiance and relationship diagrams. (20%)

Once that's all at 100% and no major bugs are in the way, expect a rollout into public beta, then stable. Soon!
